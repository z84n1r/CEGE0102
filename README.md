CEGE0102:   Professional Skills   in   Civil   Engineering
CAD GIS Coursework -   Here   East   Car   Park
For this   practical, you will consolidate GIS and   CAD   skills   that   you   have   already   learned   and      use   a   new   application,   FME   Workbench, to   model   a   building,   design   a   carpark   and   produce a   3D   map.
You   will   be   assessed   on   the   accuracy   and   presentation   of   your   maps.   The   assessment   constitutes   15% of the   module   CEGE0102: Professional Skills in   Civil Engineering.   Please   submitted your coursework   before the deadline. Group   deadlines can   be found   in   the   assessment tab on   Moodle and at the end   of this   document.
Description
Your task   is to   produce two   maps   (3D and   2D)   using GIS software   of the   Here   East   site,   showing   the   following   features   of   interest:

A go代 写CEGE0102: Professional Skills in Civil EngineeringR
代做程序编程语言od   map   (70+) will   meet all the specifications above. An   excellent   map   (80+)   will   meet   and   exceed   the   specifications   through   excellent   cartography,   creativity   and/or   use of additional functions or data that were   not   introduced   in the   practical   sessions.       In   order   to   ensure   agood   grade,   in   addition   to   meeting   the   specifications   you   should   avoid errors such   as:
•         Topographical   errors
•          Misaligned   Carpark   Lines
•          Carpark   lines do   not   meet   car   parking   bay size standards
•          Unclear   presentation   (e.g. distinguishable colours, overlapping feature,   labels   or   boundary,   blank space etc)
•          Inappropriate scale   bar   units   (should   be   metric,   appropriate   units and   intervals for   the scale at   which the   map   is   displayed)
•          Missing elements   in the   map   or   legend
•          Map   not   exported as   PDF   (Screenshot/.   mxd)
•          Map   not   provided   in GIS   software
•          3D   building   not   included
•          Elements   not within their designated   areas   (building, carpark etc)
Attention to detail   is crucial   in order to   achieve the top   grades.
